## Multi-Layer Perceptron

* Teacher class
* Error threshold
* Callable reset/init func with params

* A MLP can be represented by a list of Layer where :
        Layer(activationFct, nb_neurons);
  -> Parse a file? Templates?
* Check in keras.io

* Work with matrices instead?
* Bias != threshold?

* Learn the XOR (at least) then OCR

* FIXMEs

--> Github/Bitbucket this!
